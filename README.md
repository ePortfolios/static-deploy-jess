# Static Site Deployment – Next.js

This project is a bare bones static site created with Next.js as part of a deployment assignment.

The goal of this project was to demonstrate:
- Managing source code with GitHub
- Making a unique edit to the default Next.js project
- Building and exporting a static site
- Deploying the site to a live server using GitHub Pages

## Live Site
https://eportfolios.github.io/static-deploy-jess/

## Tech Used
- Next.js
- Static export (`output: "export"`)
- GitHub Pages for hosting

## Notes
This project was intentionally kept simple to focus on deployment and version control rather than design complexity.
